Without limiting the foregoing, Client will clearly and conspicuously disclose to users all terms, conditions and restrictions that are applicable to use of Products in accordance with applicable law but such terms, conditions and restrictions must not conflict with this Section and must not prevent use of the Product in a manner which a user would reasonably be expected to be able to use the Product based on the Offer. In no event will use by users of Products be subject to any recurring or automatic subscriptions or the payment of any fees or taxes. Client may target the Sampling Unit only to those users that are eligible for the Offer, and Client shall ensure that the Offer and Product is age appropriate for eligible users. HITECH makes no guarantees or commitments with respect to the number of Offers accepted. Client will ensure that the Offer, Product and delivery of the Product complies with any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, Client shall disclose within the Offer all information about Client’s identity as required by and in accordance with applicable law.  No approval by or assistance from HITECH in connection with an Offer (including as may be specified in an IO or elsewhere) shall reduce or satisfy the obligations of Client in relation to the Offer. Client shall ensure that all representations made in relation to the Product or Offer are accurate and must not make any false or misleading or deceptive statements.
